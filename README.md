# connect_four
Classic game implementation using Rspec TDD and Ruby

In this game you take turns dropping pieces into the board
from the top. You win by being the first to get four of
your pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

As my first TDD project, the challenge was developing tests prior to 
implementation details.  Many times I struggled and had to write
some methods prior to tests just to get an idea of what the 
method needed to do.  This was especially for the top level
public methods.  I suspect the reason is that I don't have 
a separate design phase.  I design in code with comments
and method names.  So I might still need to update my design
procedure to better leverage TDD benefits.
